# SharpLoadLibrary
SharpLoadLibrary is a program that imitates LoadLibrary, and its designed for offensive operations. For now, the program is hella unstable, and it has some problem loading/executing some system DLLs. SharpLoadLibrary doesnt have the ability to link the loaded module to PEB, yet. Contributions and fixes is super appreciated.
